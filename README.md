## Google what you need.
> A Zoom bot written in node.js. The main function of this bot is to help you google whatever you need within the Zoom application.
This is a bot that enables the search for whatever you need to search for. Just use the `/google` command. :)

## Instructions
If you want to mess around with this bot then i personally used nodemon to run it on my localhost:4000 and then ran ngrok.io on using the `ngrok http 4000` command, as per zoom's recommended guide here: https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/chatbots/build-a-chatbot .
